### 77.5 配置JPA属性

Spring Data JPA已经提供了一些独立的配置选项（比如，针对SQL日志），并且Spring Boot会暴露它们，针对hibernate的外部配置属性也更多些。Some of them are automatically detected according to the context so you shouldn’t have to set them.

The spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto is a special case in that it has different defaults depending on whether you are using an embedded database (create-drop) or not (none). The dialect to use is also automatically detected based on the current DataSource but you can set spring.jpa.database yourself if you want to be explicit and bypass that check on startup.

[Note]
Specifying a database leads to the configuration of a well-defined Hibernate dialect. Several databases have more than one Dialect and this may not suit your need. In that case, you can either set spring.jpa.database to default to let Hibernate figure things out or set the dialect using the spring.jpa.database-platform property.

最常见的选项如下：
```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=com.example.MyPhysicalNamingStrategy
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```
In addition all properties in spring.jpa.properties.* are passed through as normal JPA properties (with the prefix stripped) when the local EntityManagerFactory is created.
