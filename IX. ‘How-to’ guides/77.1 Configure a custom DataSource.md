### 77.1 配置自定义的数据源

To configure your own DataSource define a @Bean of that type in your configuration. Spring Boot will reuse your DataSource anywhere one is required, including database initialization. If you need to externalize some settings, you can easily bind your DataSource to the environment (see Section 24.7.1, “Third-party configuration”).
在你的配置中自定义那种类型的`@Bean`来配置你自己的数据源。当需要数据源时，Spring Boot将会重复使用你的数据源，包括数据库的初始化。如果你需要具体化一些配置，你可以轻松的将你的数据源跟`Environment`绑定（[查看24.7.1章节，“第三方配置”](../IV. Spring Boot features/24.7.1. Third-party configuration.md)）。
```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="app.datasource")
public DataSource dataSource() {
    return new FancyDataSource();
}
```
```properties
app.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:mydb
app.datasource.username=sa
app.datasource.pool-size=30
```
Assuming that your FancyDataSource has regular JavaBean properties for the url, the username and the pool size, these settings will be bound automatically before the DataSource is made available to other components. The regular database initialization will also happen (so the relevant sub-set of spring.datasource.* can still be used with your custom configuration).

You can apply the same principle if you are configuring a custom JNDI DataSource:

@Bean(destroyMethod="")
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="app.datasource")
public DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {
    JndiDataSourceLookup dataSourceLookup = new JndiDataSourceLookup();
    return dataSourceLookup.getDataSource("java:comp/env/jdbc/YourDS");
}

Spring Boot also provides a utility builder class DataSourceBuilder that can be used to create one of the standard data sources (if it is on the classpath). The builder can detect the one to use based on what’s available on the classpath. It also auto detects the driver based on the JDBC url.
```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public DataSource dataSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
}
```
To run an app with that DataSource, all that is needed really is the connection information; pool-specific settings can also be provided, check the implementation that is going to be used at runtime for more details.

app.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.pool-size=30
There is a catch however. Because the actual type of the connection pool is not exposed, no keys are generated in the metadata for your custom DataSource and no completion is available in your IDE (The DataSource interface doesn’t expose any property). Also, if you happen to have Hikari on the classpath, this basic setup will not work because Hikari has no url parameter (but a jdbcUrl parameter). You will have to rewrite your configuration as follows:

app.datasource.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.maximum-pool-size=30
You can fix that by forcing the connection pool to use and return a dedicated implementation rather than DataSource. You won’t be able to change the implementation at runtime but the list of options will be explicit.

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public HikariDataSource dataSource() {
    return (HikariDataSource) DataSourceBuilder.create()
            .type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}
You can even go further by leveraging what DataSourceProperties does for you, that is providing a default embedded database if no url is provided with a sensible username and password for it. You can easily initialize a DataSourceBuilder from the state of any DataSourceProperties so you could just as well inject the one Spring Boot creates automatically. However, that would split your configuration in two namespaces: url, username, password, type and driver on spring.datasource and the rest on your custom namespace (app.datasource). To avoid that, you can redefine a custom DataSourceProperties on your custom namespace:

@Bean
@Primary
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties() {
    return new DataSourceProperties();
}

@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")
public HikariDataSource dataSource(DataSourceProperties properties) {
    return (HikariDataSource) properties.initializeDataSourceBuilder()
            .type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
}
This setup puts you in pair with what Spring Boot does for you by default, except that a dedicated connection pool is chosen (in code) and its settings are exposed in the same namespace. Because DataSourceProperties is taking care of the url/jdbcUrl translation for you, you can configure it like this:

app.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
app.datasource.username=dbuser
app.datasource.password=dbpass
app.datasource.maximum-pool-size=30
[Note]
Because your custom configuration chooses to go with Hikari, app.datasource.type will have no effect. In practice the builder will be initialized with whatever value you might set there and then overridden by the call to .type().
