### 28.1 MVC Security

The default security configuration is implemented in `SecurityAutoConfiguration` and in the classes imported from there (`SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `AuthenticationManagerConfiguration` for authentication configuration, which is also relevant in non-web applications). To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` (doing so does not disable the authentication manager configuration or Actuatorâ€™s security).

To also switch off the authentication manager configuration, you can add a bean of type `UserDetailsService`, `AuthenticationProvider`, or `AuthenticationManager`. There are several secure applications in the [Spring Boot samples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.0.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-samples/) to get you started with common use cases.

Access rules can be overridden by adding a custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. `EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property. `PathRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.
