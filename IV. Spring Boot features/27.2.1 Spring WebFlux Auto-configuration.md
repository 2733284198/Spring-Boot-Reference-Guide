### 27.2.1 Spring WebFlux自动配置

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring WebFlux that works well with most applications.

The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Spring’s defaults:

- Configuring codecs for `HttpMessageReader` and `HttpMessageWriter` instances (described [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webflux-httpcodecs)).
- Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (described [later in this document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-static-content)).

If you want to keep Spring Boot WebFlux features and you want to add additional [WebFlux configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-reactive), you can add your own `@Configuration` class of type `WebFluxConfigurer` but without `@EnableWebFlux`.

If you want to take complete control of Spring WebFlux, you can add your own `@Configuration` annotated with `@EnableWebFlux`.
