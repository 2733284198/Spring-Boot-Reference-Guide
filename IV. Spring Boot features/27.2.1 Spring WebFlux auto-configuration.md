### 27.2.1 Spring WebFlux auto-configuration

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring WebFlux that works well with most applications.

The auto-configuration adds the following features on top of Springâ€™s defaults:

Configuring codecs for HttpMessageReader and HttpMessageWriter instances (see below).
Support for serving static resources, including support for WebJars (see below).
If you want to keep Spring Boot WebFlux features, and you just want to add additional WebFlux configuration you can add your own @Configuration class of type WebFluxConfigurer, but without @EnableWebFlux.

If you want to take complete control of Spring WebFlux, you can add your own @Configuration annotated with @EnableWebFlux.
