### 46.4.2 覆盖类路径

It is also possible to test what happens when a particular class and/or package is not present at runtime. Spring Boot ships with a `FilteredClassLoader` that can easily be used by the runner. In the following example, we assert that if `UserService` is not present, the auto-configuration is properly disabled:
```java
@Test
public void serviceIsIgnoredIfLibraryIsNotPresent() {
	this.contextRunner.withClassLoader(new FilteredClassLoader(UserService.class))
			.run((context) -> assertThat(context).doesNotHaveBean("userService"));
}
```
