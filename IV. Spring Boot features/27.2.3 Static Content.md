### 27.2.3 Static Content

By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called `/static` (or `/public` or `/resources` or `/META-INF/resources`) in the classpath. It uses the `ResourceWebHandler` from Spring WebFlux so that you can modify that behavior by adding your own `WebFluxConfigurer` and overriding the `addResourceHandlers` method.

By default, resources are mapped on `/**`, but you can tune that by setting the `spring.webflux.static-path-pattern` property. For instance, relocating all resources to `/resources/**` can be achieved as follows:

```properties
spring.webflux.static-path-pattern=/resources/**
```

You can also customize the static resource locations by using `spring.resources.static-locations`. Doing so replaces the default values with a list of directory locations. If you do so, the default welcome page detection switches to your custom locations. So, if there is an `index.html` in any of your locations on startup, it is the home page of the application.

In addition to the “standard” static resource locations listed earlier, a special case is made for [Webjars content](http://www.webjars.org/). Any resources with a path in `/webjars/**` are served from jar files if they are packaged in the Webjars format.

**注** Spring WebFlux applications do not strictly depend on the Servlet API, so they cannot be deployed as war files and do not use the  `src/main/webapp` directory.
