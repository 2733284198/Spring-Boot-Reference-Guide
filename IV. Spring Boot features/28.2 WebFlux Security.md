### 28.2 WebFlux安全

Similar to Spring MVC applications, you can secure your WebFlux applications by adding the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency. The default security configuration is implemented in `ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration` and in the classes imported from there (`WebFluxSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `ReactiveAuthenticationManagerConfiguration` for authentication configuration, which is also relevant in non-web applications). To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type `WebFilterChainProxy` (doing so does not disable the authentication manager configuration or Actuator’s security).

To also switch off the authentication manager configuration, you can add a bean of type `ReactiveUserDetailsService` or `ReactiveAuthenticationManager`.

Access rules can be configured by adding a custom `SecurityWebFilterChain`. Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources. `EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property.

`PathRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.

For example, you can customize your security configuration by adding something like:

```java
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
	http
		.authorizeExchange()
			.matchers(PathRequest.toStaticResources().atCommonLocations()).permitAll()
			.pathMatchers("/foo", "/bar")
				.authenticated().and()
			.formLogin();
	return http.build();
}
```
