### 27.2.4 模板引擎

As well as REST web services, you can also use Spring WebFlux to serve dynamic HTML content. Spring WebFlux supports a variety of templating technologies, including Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and Mustache.

Spring Boot includes auto-configuration support for the following templating engines:

- [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/docs/)
- [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/)
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/)

When you use one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your templates are picked up automatically from `src/main/resources/templates`.
