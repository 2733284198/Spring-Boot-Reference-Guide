### 46.4 测试你的自动配置

An auto-configuration can be affected by many factors: user configuration (`@Bean` definition and `Environment` customization), condition evaluation (presence of a particular library), and others. Concretely, each test should create a well defined `ApplicationContext` that represents a combination of those customizations. `ApplicationContextRunner` provides a great way to achieve that.

`ApplicationContextRunner` is usually defined as a field of the test class to gather the base, common configuration. The following example makes sure that `UserServiceAutoConfiguration` is always invoked:
```java
private final ApplicationContextRunner contextRunner = new ApplicationContextRunner()
		.withConfiguration(AutoConfigurations.of(UserServiceAutoConfiguration.class));
```

**注** If multiple auto-configurations have to be defined, there is no need to order their declarations as they are invoked in the exact same order as when running the application.

Each test can use the runner to represent a particular use case. For instance, the sample below invokes a user configuration (`UserConfiguration`) and checks that the auto-configuration backs off properly. Invoking `run` provides a callback context that can be used with `Assert4J`.
```java
@Test
public void defaultServiceBacksOff() {
	this.contextRunner.withUserConfiguration(UserConfiguration.class)
			.run((context) -> {
				assertThat(context).hasSingleBean(UserService.class);
				assertThat(context.getBean(UserService.class)).isSameAs(
						context.getBean(UserConfiguration.class).myUserService());
			});
}

@Configuration
static class UserConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public UserService myUserService() {
		return new UserService("mine");
	}

}
```
It is also possible to easily customize the `Environment`, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Test
public void serviceNameCanBeConfigured() {
	this.contextRunner.withPropertyValues("user.name=test123").run((context) -> {
		assertThat(context).hasSingleBean(UserService.class);
		assertThat(context.getBean(UserService.class).getName()).isEqualTo("test123");
	});
}
```
