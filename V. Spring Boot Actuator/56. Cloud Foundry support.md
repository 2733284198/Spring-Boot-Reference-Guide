### 56. Cloud Foundry support
Spring Boot’s actuator module includes additional support that is activated when you deploy to a compatible Cloud Foundry instance. The /cloudfoundryapplication path provides an alternative secured route to all NamedMvcEndpoint beans.

The extended support allows Cloud Foundry management UIs (such as the web application that you can use to view deployed applications) to be augmented with Spring Boot actuator information. For example, an application status page may include full health information instead of the typical “running” or “stopped” status.

[Note]
The /cloudfoundryapplication path is not directly accessible to regular users. In order to use the endpoint a valid UAA token must be passed with the request.
