### 50.2 暴露端点

Since Endpoints may contain sensitive information, careful consideration should be given about when to expose them. The following table shows the default exposure for the built-in endpoints:

| ID | JMX　|Web|
| ---- | :----- | :----- |
|`auditevents`|Yes|No|
|`beans`|Yes|No|
|`conditions`|Yes|No|
|`configprops`|Yes|No|
|`env`|Yes|No|
|`flyway`|Yes|No|
|`health`|Yes|Yes|
|`heapdump`|N/A|No|
|`httptrace`|Yes|No|
|`info`|Yes|Yes|
|`jolokia`|N/A|No|
|`logfile`|N/A|No|
|`loggers`|Yes|No|
|`liquibase`|Yes|No|
|`metrics`|Yes|No|
|`mappings`|Yes|No|
|`prometheus`|N/A|No|
|`scheduledtasks`|Yes|No|
|`sessions`|Yes|No|
|`shutdown`|Yes|No|
|`threaddump`|Yes|No|

To change which endpoints are exposed, use the following technology-specific `include` and `exclude` properties:

| Property | Default　|
| ---- | :----- |
|`management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude`||
|`management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include`|`*`|
|`management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude`||
|`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include`|`info, health`|

The `include` property lists the IDs of the endpoints that are exposed. The `exclude` property lists the IDs of the endpoints that should not be exposed. The `exclude` property takes precedence over the `include` property. Both `include` and `exclude` properties can be configured with a list of endpoint IDs.

For example, to stop exposing all endpoints over JMX and only expose the `health` and `info` endpoints, use the following property:
```properties
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=health,info
```
`*` can be used to select all endpoints. For example, to expose everything over HTTP except the `env` and `beans` endpoints, use the following properties:
```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=env,beans
```

**注** If your application is exposed publicly, we strongly recommend that you also [secure your endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-security).

**注** If you want to implement your own strategy for when endpoints are exposed, you can register an `EndpointFilter` bean.
