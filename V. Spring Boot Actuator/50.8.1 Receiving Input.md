### 50.8.1 接收输入

Operations on an endpoint receive input via their parameters. When exposed via the web, the values for these parameters are taken from the URL’s query parameters and from the JSON request body. When exposed via JMX, the parameters are mapped to the parameters of the MBean’s operations. Parameters are required by default. They can be made optional by annotating them with `@org.springframework.lang.Nullable`.

**注** To allow the input to be mapped to the operation method’s parameters, code implementing an endpoint should be compiled with `-parameters`. This will happen automatically if you are using Spring Boot’s Gradle plugin or if you are using Maven and `spring-boot-starter-parent`.

**Input type conversion**
The parameters passed to endpoint operation methods are, if necessary, automatically converted to the required type. Before calling an operation method, the input received via JMX or an HTTP request is converted to the required types using an instance of `ApplicationConversionService`.
