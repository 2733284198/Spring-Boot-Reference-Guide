### 50.8.4 Controller端点

`@ControllerEndpoint` and `@RestControllerEndpoint` can be used to implement an endpoint that is only exposed by Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux. Methods are mapped using the standard annotations Spring MVC and Spring WevFlux annotations such as `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`, with the endpoint’s ID being used as a prefix for the path. Controller endpoints provide deeper integration with Spring’s web frameworks but at the expense of portability. The `@Endpoint` and `@WebEndpoint` annotations should be preferred whenever possible.
