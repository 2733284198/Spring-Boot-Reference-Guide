### 51. Loggers
Spring Boot Actuator includes the ability to view and configure the log levels of your application at runtime. You can view either the entire list or an individual loggerâ€™s configuration which is made up of both the explicitly configured logging level as well as the effective logging level given to it by the logging framework. These levels can be:

TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARN
ERROR
FATAL
OFF
null
with null indicating that there is no explicit configuration.
