### 50.9.3 响应式的健康指示器

For reactive applications, such as those using Spring WebFlux, `ReactiveHealthIndicator` provides a non-blocking contract for getting application health. Similar to a traditional `HealthIndicator`, health information is collected from all [`ReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.0.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/ReactiveHealthIndicator.java) beans defined in your `ApplicationContext`. Regular `HealthIndicator` beans that do not check against a reactive API are included and executed on the elastic scheduler.

To provide custom health information from a reactive API, you can register Spring beans that implement the [`ReactiveHealthIndicator`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.0.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/ReactiveHealthIndicator.java) interface. The following code shows a sample `ReactiveHealthIndicator` implementation:

```
@Component
public class MyReactiveHealthIndicator implements ReactiveHealthIndicator {

	@Override
	public Mono<Health> health() {
		return doHealthCheck() //perform some specific health check that returns a Mono<Health>
			.onErrorResume(ex -> Mono.just(new Health.Builder().down(ex).build())));
	}

}
```

**注** To handle the error automatically, consider extending from `AbstractReactiveHealthIndicator`.
