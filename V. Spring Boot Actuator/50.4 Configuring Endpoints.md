### 50.4 配置端点

Endpoints automatically cache responses to read operations that do not take any parameters. To configure the amount of time for which an endpoint will cache a response, use its `cache.time-to-live` property. The following example sets the time-to-live of the `beans` endpoint’s cache to 10 seconds:

**application.properties.**
```properties
management.endpoint.beans.cache.time-to-live=10s
```

**注** The prefix management.endpoint.<name> is used to uniquely identify the endpoint that is being configured.

**注** When making an authenticated HTTP request, the Principal is considered as input to the endpoint and, therefore, the response will not be cached.
