### 56.3 Custom security configuration
If you define custom security configuration, and you want extended Cloud Foundry actuator support, you’ll should ensure that /cloudfoundryapplication/** paths are open. Without a direct open route, your Cloud Foundry application manager will not be able to obtain endpoint data.

For Spring Security, you’ll typically include something like mvcMatchers("/cloudfoundryapplication/**").permitAll() in your configuration:

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .mvcMatchers("/cloudfoundryapplication/**")
                .permitAll()
            .mvcMatchers("/mypath")
                .hasAnyRole("SUPERUSER")
            .anyRequest()
                .authenticated().and()
        .httpBasic();
}
