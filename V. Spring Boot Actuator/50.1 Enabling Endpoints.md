### 50.1 启用端点

By default, all endpoints except for `shutdown` are enabled. To configure the enablement of an endpoint, use its `management.endpoint.<id>.enabled` property. The following example enables the `shutdown` endpoint:
```java
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true
```
If you prefer endpoint enablement to be opt-in rather than opt-out, set the `management.endpoints.enabled-by-default` property to `false` and use individual endpoint `enabled` properties to opt back in. The following example enables the `info` endpoint and disables all other endpoints:
```java
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false
management.endpoint.info.enabled=true
```
**注** Disabled endpoints are removed entirely from the application context. If you want to change only the technologies over which an endpoint is exposed, use the [`include` and `exclude` properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints) instead.
