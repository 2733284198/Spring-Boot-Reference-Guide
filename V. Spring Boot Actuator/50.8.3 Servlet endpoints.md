### 50.8.3 Servlet端点

A `Servlet` can be exposed as an endpoint by implementing a class annotated with `@ServletEndpoint` that also implements `Supplier<EndpointServlet>`. Servlet endpoints provide deeper integration with the Servlet container but at the expose of portability. They are intended to be used to expose an existing `Servlet` as an endpoint. For new endpoints, the `@Endpoint` and `@WebEndpoint` annotations should be preferred whenever possible.
